belak There's a chance it'll hit 38 again today
belak Yeah, initial price

belak So, you still want to write the platformer in Go?
belak Ehhh
belak Alright
belak I will rarely say this, but this is one thing I'd rather not do in Go...
belak It involves reinventing a lot of wheels. There are no good physics library bindings, so I'd have to write some... and there are no tmx bindings...
belak Yes. There's a TMX library that I'm familiar with and have converted to C++ as well as multiple physics libraries (box2d and chipmunk come to mind)
belak Also, we have part of the renderer
belak Well, kinda
belak Thank god
belak lol
belak Plus graphics library support for hardware acceleration is a LOT better
belak Do you have any ideas for a graphics library you'd like to work with? We already have 2/3 of the renderer in Allegro
belak Also, I would like to request a change to your allegro install... I'd like to use 5.1 because it has support for drawing polygons (which we'll need for debug drawing with the physics bodies)
belak I have the required changes to the allegro.rb brew file
belak It's one line
belak lol
belak .0
belak 5.0
belak 5.1 stable isn't officially released
belak head 'git://git.code.sf.net/p/alleg/allegro' needs to go somewhere in the top portion
belak so, brew edit allegro5
belak Then brew install allegro5 --HEAD will build and install it
belak I <3 cmake
belak Not many build systems would work the same between git and releases
belak I also have a magical cmake addition that will build all the files in a directory in stead of having to specify them
belak Run it in screen in the launchd script
belak Or use dtach
belak Yeah
belak They took Rapture, before the fall...
belak And it's with the infinite engine
belak THe new infinite DLC
belak That was meant for #encoded
belak oops
belak lol
belak ping?
belak what's the screen cmd you're running?
belak screen -dR ~/.bin/irssi_fnotify.sh
belak I understand that
belak Name the session then
belak the -d will dtach the -R will create the session
belak sorry
belak -dmS session_name
belak I used -R in my scripts... idk
belak it's odd that what you had isn't working
belak Oh
belak Um, launchctl will actually try to relaunch if it isn't running
belak So run it in screen without the -d ?
belak Sorry, I'm just guessing now
belak pastebin launchctl file?
belak Wow, dat indentation
belak heh
belak asking about allegro 5.1 and an official release date:
belak [10:41:31] <+elias>	 ah, yes, no reason to stick to 5.0
belak [10:42:59] <+elias>	 5.1 has more features and less bugs and they never broke the API yet even within the unstable branch
belak kk
belak OH! Let me know if you think of any names for the game
belak Ugh, idk how to connect to mysql
